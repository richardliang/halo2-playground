# Halo2 Examples (Forked from Axiom's Halo2 Scaffold)

A bunch of random circuits I'm building to learn Halo2 / Axiom's flexgates

- ZKOTP - Inspired by the [Circom implementation](https://github.com/socathie/zkOTP/tree/master)
- Etc

## Setup

Follow instructions at [Halo2 Scaffold](https://github.com/axiom-crypto/halo2-scaffold.git)

## Todo
- Verifier contract?
- Setting up tests
